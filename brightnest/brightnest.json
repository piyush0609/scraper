Additionally, run your bath fan after taking a shower to remove damp air from the bathroom. If you don’t have a bath fan, be sure to crack a window or leave the shower door open so moisture can escape.

Old, hand-me-down cribs might have sentimental value, but they may not have been built according to modern safety regulations. To determine if your crib is safe, make sure that the space between the crib slats is no larger than 2-3/8 inches and the corner posts do not extend higher than 1/16 inch above the end panels.  ", 
        "Assemble the crib correctly. :  A lot of cribs require some assembly. Be sure to follow the instructions to a tee. Also tighten all the hardware twice and make sure there are no sharp edges poking out anywhere that your baby’s clothing could get snagged on. It’s also important to make sure that the mattress fits snugly inside the crib so that your baby can’t get trapped between the mattress and the crib slats. ", 
        "Mobiles and toys. :  Make sure that any mobiles you hang above your crib are out of reach and tightly secured. They’re to be seen and not touched! Once your child is capable of getting up on his or her hands, it’s time to remove your mobile – it’s a choking hazard! It’s also best to keep pillows, quilts, comforters and toys out of the crib except during supervised playtime because they’re potential choking hazards as well. If you do want to give them a blanket while they sleep, make sure it’s extremely lightweight. ",

        "Bedding. :  Once a week, wash your baby’s bedding in hot water (over 130 degrees F). A typical mattress can harbor between 100,000 to 10 million dust mites, which are a common cause of eye irritation and allergies in infants. ", 
        "Changing table. :  Your changing table is going to get a lot of use, so be sure to get a good one! A few important elements are: a low level guardrail, a waterproof pad and a safety strap to secure around your baby’s middle to keep them in place when you reach for changing supplies. Also, be sure to set your changing table up in an area where there aren’t any drapes or blind cords within reach. ", 
        "Nightlights :  If you use a nightlight, make sure it’s a cool-burning nightlight, which doesn’t get hot and won’t create a fire hazard. Even if you have a cool-burning nightlight, make sure that it isn’t touching any bedding or draperies that could ignite. ", 
        "Wall color. :  Babies can’t detect complex patterns and details until they’re about nine months old, so if you’re not partial to ornate patterns, it’s best to choose simple, high-contrast colors like black and white because they’re more soothing (be sure to ",

The vinegar will absorb pretty much any odor – everything from cigarette smoke to pet odors. Don’t worry about the vinegar smell that may remain, it will dissipate quickly once the vinegar is removed. ",

You can try using baking soda if you’re closet odors aren’t that bad, but sometimes this isn’t enough. Should you need a more powerful option, try leaving a bowl of kitty litter in your closet for a few days. If it can absorb the smell of cat poop, it can absorb the smell of your clothing and shoes.    ",

For wood pieces, mix a 1-1 solution of vinegar and water, then wipe a light coating of the mixture on your furniture with a sponge and allow it to dry. For fabric sofas, sprinkle some baking soda on the cushions and let it sit overnight, then vacuum it off in the morning. This trick generally works better than store-bought fresheners, and doesn’t include any chemicals or toxins! ", 
        "Cabinets. :  You could place a small dish of baking soda in your cabinets to keep them stink-free, but why not give your dishes some extra love? Put a few sprigs of lavender or mint into a glass jar and leave them in your cabinets. That way, you’ll get a waft of fresh herbs every time you reach for a plate. ", 
        "Carpets and rugs. :  For specific odors, you can sprinkle your carpets and rugs with baking soda and then vacuum, just like you did with fabric sofas in step #6. To keep things consistently fresh, squeeze some lemon or lime juice into your vacuum bag before each use. The scent will be transferred to your rug or carpet so you can enjoy a nice citrus smell. For more tips, read: ", 
        "The kitchen. :  Your stovetop is a natural de-stinking tool. For light odors, simmer some citrus zest and a teaspoon of cinnamon in some water for 10-15 minutes to cancel out minor smells. For stronger odors, simmer white vinegar for 30-45 minutes to absorb and remove the problem.", 
        "Pet odors. :  If your furry friend is leaving behind an odor, one of the best ways to control it is by giving your pet regular baths. If you have fish, be sure to clean the tank regularly as well. For “emergency” issues, try blotting with white vinegar followed by club soda if the problem is still wet. If it’s dry, or odor still remains, sprinkle some baking soda and then vacuum a few hours later. If you just can’t seem to get that pet odor off the sofa, it may be time to set some new boundaries for your pet! "
    ], 
    "reason" : "No matter how fastidious you are, your house is going to create some odors. If you leave your sofa, carpet and trash can odors unchecked, they’ll eventually start wafting a powerful and unpleasant stench in all directions. Different areas require different tactics, but all of these de-stinking tricks can be accomplished with a few household items you probably already own.",

        "Unplug your water softener. :  Before you clean any parts of your water softener or add anything to the tanks, always unplug your water softener from its power source to prevent electrocution. It’s also a good idea to consult your owner’s manual for details on each of these steps.", 
        "Locate your water softener’s manual recharge button. :  This may also be a knob, and will be at the top of your water softener with the rest of the control panel. It will likely be labeled. Consult your owner’s manual for the exact shape and location. ", 
        "Locate your water softener’s timer. :  This will be in the same area as the regeneration/recharge button. The timer controls what time of day your water softener automatically recharges. Make sure this cycle is occurring during hours you aren’t using water, like when you’re sleeping. ", 
        "Check the salt levels in the brine tank. :  This should be done every two to three months even if your softener is working properly. The brine tank is usually the shorter of the two tanks, and contains a salt mixture. Make sure that the salt level doesn’t fall below one-third (if it’s low and requires a refill, only fill it to two-thirds full). If the salt level is low, and you notice a “salt mush,” remove it before adding more salt. This thick paste doesn’t dissolve well and makes it harder for your water softener to do its job.", 
        "Inspect the inside walls of your brine tank. :  Check the brine tank for salt residue buildup, which will look like a white crust. If there is salt residue along the sides, unplug your water softener and remove the buildup using a soft brush and warm water. If possible, detach your brine tank from the water softener and empty any remaining water into a drain. Take it outside and rinse it with a hose. ", 
        "Remove iron (optional): :  Some water sources contain high amounts of iron. If you’re not sure about your iron levels, contact your local water utility and ask them for a recent reading. If your water does contain iron, use a rust remover such as Iron-Out once a year to clean the resin bed of your water softener. You can find these products at your local home improvement store for about $10 – just check the label to make sure they’re designed for use in water softeners. The resin bed is located at the bottom of your resin tank (the taller of the two tanks that does not contain salt). Always adhere to your owner’s manual and the rust remover’s instructions when cleaning the resin bed.", 
        "Restart your water softener. :  When you’ve finished cleaning your softener, run your softener through a manual regeneration by activating the regeneration/recharge button you located in step #2. This will manually drain the wastewater in the water softener and start a fresh cycle. "
    ], 
    "reason" : "If your water softener isn’t properly maintained, it won't eliminate hard water and could damage your plumbing! As if that isn’t enough, untreated hard water will leave unsightly mineral deposits on your shower, toilet, dishes and even in your hair. Inspect your water softener at least once a year to make sure it’s working properly. ",

It’s important to vacuum once a week as well to remove dirt from between your floor boards. It’s best to use a vacuum that doesn’t have a spinning brush (or has a brush that can be deactivated) because the bristles can damage your floor. ",

This way, you don’t run the risk of accidentally damaging the finish or color of your floor when you clean it. Always follow the instructions on the cleaner you purchase, and make sure it’s designed for the type of wood you own. When you apply the cleaner, wring your mop out thoroughly before wiping it on your floors to avoid excess water, which can warp your floors. It’s a good idea to go over the floor a second time with plain water to avoid a filmy buildup. ",

        "Clean up spills quickly. :  Food and liquid bits can warp and stain your wood, so be sure to clean them up as fast as possible. You can use a damp cloth or sponge for this, just make sure to dry the area thoroughly afterwards.", 
        "Repair scratches. :  No matter how careful you are, scratches happen. Luckily, they’re easy to fix! Simply rub a walnut (pecans, almonds and Brazil nuts also work) into the scratch so that it fills the area. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes so that the oil from the nut soaks in and repairs the scratch. Then, buff the area with a soft cloth. ", 
        "Refinishing. :  If your floor has become really worn down or damaged, refinishing it will restore its original shine. However, this is a laborious and expensive process that involves a lot of sanding, staining and drying time, so try the light cleaning done in step #3 before resorting to a full refinish. If you want to have a professional refinish your floors for you, it will generally cost $200-$250 for a simple recoating and much more for a full refinish, which involves sanding and several coats of finish. The exact price for a full refinish is based entirely on the square footage of the room, so it can vary quite a bit and may cost $2,000 or more if you have a lot of ground to cover."

        "Inspect your wood. :  Wood is porous, so check your wood siding carefully for mold or mildew. If you see dark spots on your siding, chances are you have a mold or mildew problem (even houses that aren’t shaded can develop this problem). Mold and mildew on wood siding can be a sign of more serious moisture problems such as excessive indoor humidity or a leaking roof, so if you see a lot of dark spots, we recommend contacting a professional to deal with the problem. If you don’t notice any mold or mildew spots, you can skip step #2.  Jump to step #3 if you’re going to paint your siding. If you’re going to stain your siding, jump to step #8.", 
        "Fight mold and mildew. :  It’s important to remove any mold and mildew you find because wood is porous and problems can spread quickly. Don your eye protection and gloves. Then, mix ¾ cup of bleach with a gallon of water. Dip your sponge into your mixed solution, and use light pressure to scrub the moldy areas. Leave your bleach solution on the problem areas for half an hour and then rinse the solution thoroughly. If you’re going to stain your wood siding, not paint it, jump to step #8. ", 
        "Inspect your paint. :  Inspect your siding for weathered or worn paint. If you find worn areas, use a wire brush to remove any cobwebs and dirt from the surface. Always brush in the same direction as the grain of the wood. ", 
        "Scrape away loose paint. :  With your paint scraper, remove any remaining loose paint that didn’t come off with the wire brush. You want to paint your new coat on clean, splinter-free wood. Again, scrape in the same direction as the wood.", 
        "Sand your siding. :  Sand the scraped areas with a fine-grit sanding block. You want the surrounding paint to blend seamlessly with the exposed wood (read: no splinters). Sand lightly until you’ve achieved this. ", 
        "Prime your wood. :  Using even strokes, paint your bare wood with primer (note that there are some products that are a combination of primer and paint that, while more expensive, may save you some time). Before you move on to step #7, allow your primer to dry for at least five hours.", 
        "Paint your wood. :  Once your primer is completely dry, apply an even coat of exterior paint over the primer. Let your first coat dry, and then paint a second coat. If you’d like to save your paint color in the cloud, check out ", 
        " Stain your siding. :  To start, sand the areas that need to be stained with a fine-grit sanding block. Sand lightly until your wood is completely smooth.  Apply a high quality water repellent wood stain to the siding with a paint roller. Make sure the stain is resin-based and not oil- or vegetable-based (mold finds these stains delicious). Read your manufacturer’s directions clearly. If they recommend a second coat, apply it once the first coat has completely dried. ", 
        "Check your foliage. :  It’s important to keep your bushes, tree branches, shrubbery and flowers away from your wood siding. Foliage contains moisture which can quickly lead to mold along your siding. A good rule of thumb is to always be able to comfortably walk between any foliage and your siding."

If you have grooves in your siding, check to make sure that stains, mold or mildew haven’t moved into the crevices. Pay particular attention to the northern side of your house, the bottom of the siding and other areas that receive little to no sunlight (mold and mildew thrive in these areas). If you see a black or green patchy area, you probably have mold. You’ll need to remove the fungus and prevent it from spreading. If you’re mold-free, skip to step #3.",

Bleach kills spores faster, but vinegar is a better option if you think your mold remover could damage nearby vegetation.

These unsightly spots can spread quickly if left unchecked, so be sure to remove any and all spots you find. Try to do this on a clear, rain-free day. First, gently brush the corroded area with a nylon scrub brush to remove any dust or cobwebs. Then, buff the spot with fine-grade steel wool or fine-grit sandpaper. Don’t put too much pressure on the spot; instead, work slowly until the corrosion chips away and you expose your siding. Once the mark is completely gone, paint the bare spot with anti-corrosion primer, which you can find at your local hardware store. Apply the primer with a paintbrush, and let it fully dry before cleaning the area again. ", 
        " For vinyl siding: move anything fire-related far, far away. :  If you have vinyl siding, it’s important to remember that it’s combustible and can melt if it’s exposed to a heat source. Move barbeque grills and readily ignitable materials like dry leaves, mulch, ",
