            "Research the artist's output.: How many works of art did the artist complete? The output of the artist in general greatly affects price. Prolific artists' pieces of work tend to be less valuable than those of artists who simply produced less, all things being equal.\n\n", 
            "Find out if there are duplicates.: Is the work one-of-a-kind? Because of supply and demand, works that are singular are worth more than replicated works. For this reason, a paintings is usually worth more than a print or a lithograph — there are simply fewer of them out on the market.\n\n", 
            "Pinpoint when in the artist's career the work was completed.: Was the work completed early on or toward the twilight of their career? Interestingly enough, works of art completed early in artists' careers are usually valued higher than those completed later on.", 
            "Ask yourself if the work epitomizes the artist's style.: Works of art that epitomize an artist's aesthetic are usually appraised higher than works of art that are tangential or not representative of the artist's oeuvre.\n\n", 
            "Investigate whether the artist is well-known or has a reputation.: Artists generally fall into three categories of renown: well-known, up-and-coming, and unknown. Artists who are well-known and have a rich history of collection can almost always command more value more than artists who are unknown.\n\n", 
            "Know that size matters.: Generally, bigger works of art are appraised higher than smaller ones, usually because of the degree of difficulty involved.", 
            "Find out if the piece of art has ever been owned by someone renowned.: Barring the artist themselves, works of art that were formerly owned by someone famous or well-known can command much higher prices than those pieces who don't ha or condition issues. An item that is ripped, water-damaged, discolored, or otherwise damaged can return significantly less than an item that is in perfect shape."
        ], 
        "Arriving at a Final Price" : [
            "Look at what other, similar pieces of art have sold for.: If you've just bough an impressionist painting in the vein of a painting that was just sold for $12,000 — all other things being equal — that should give you a good benchmark for what your painting may be worth.\n\n", 
            "Know that one-of-a-kind artworks are difficult to price, and somewhat more subject to change.: An artwork that is truly unique and doesn't have any other analogues against which to compare it is difficult to value. The appraisal arrived at is considered to be especially volatile.\n\n", 
            "Look at scale, intensity, and medium.: Scale is the size of the artwork and the level of detail. Intensity is the level of effort put into the artwork. Medium is the quality of the materials used. Combine these three aspects together and you should have a better idea of what your artwork is worth."

        "Taking the Market's Pulse" : [
            "Investigate market demand.: In short, how many people want to buy the piece of art? Art is sold in a market. This means that the value of items offered in the market fluctuates depending on how much buyers want the piece, as well as how much they are willing to pay. Ask yourself if the market is in a peak, where demand is usually high, or a trough, where demand is depressed.\n\n",

Here are some books to get you started:\n\n",

Well, check out what people are reading on planes, beaches, etc, and also check out the New York Times bestseller list to check out which books are on the list.

If you want to build a solid foundation for your understanding of the books you read, then you can't avoid some of the earliest plays, poems, and oral tales ever written down. Remember that the novel didn't really get popular until the 18th century, so you won't find novels on this list. Without reading the poetry of Homer or the plays of Sophocles, you won't be able to call yourself well-read. Here's a list to get you started:\n\n",

What's your vice--cheesy detective novels, Harlequin romances, or thrillers? Whatever books you really love to read, don't give 'em up just to read Charles Dickens. Instead, reward yourself: say that for every classic novel or literary novel you read, you'll get to read one thriller, one beach romance, or one book of whatever genre you love the most.\n\n",

Book clubs will keep you from speeding from one book to the next without stopping to think what it all means.\n\n",

There's no point in being well-read if you can't use your knowledge to have interesting discussions with other people.\n\n", 
            "Listen to podcasts.: You can download free podcasts, such as the New Yorker Fiction podcasts, or KCRW's weekly Bookworm podcasts, to hear writers read from their favorite stories or to hear authors discuss their new books. You can also get your news from podcasts, and listen anything from Chekhov's stories to classic speeches in American history, such as the Gettysburg address.

            "Read the literature carefully.: You start a critique not when you sit down to write the essay, but when you sit down to read the work of literature. Ask yourself why the characters do the things they do in all works of literature, whether novels, short stories, essays, or poems.\n\n", 
            "Create a graphic organizer.: To help you organize the plot and characters so that you can think about the text, it is useful to make a graphic organizer. There are many ways to set up a chart so that you can organize your observations, including an idea web, Venn diagram, T-chart, and more.", 
            "Think about the literal meaning.: After you are done reading a piece of literature, think about what each character did and how each action contributed to the plot. Look at your graphic organizer to help you understand what happened in the book. Don’t try to decide what that author is saying at this point. Just look at the actions and plot at face value.\n\n", 
            "Think about what the author might be suggesting about society or humanity.: After you have a good understanding of the events of the book, you can try to understand what the author was suggesting about human nature through the characters and their actions. These things are called the themes.\n\n", 
            "Form a thesis statement.: After you have selected one lesson the reader can learn from the work of literature, it is time to make a thesis statement out of it. A thesis statement is a single sentence that makes a claim about the piece of literature that can be supported using textual evidence, such as quotes from the piece of literature.", 
            "Locate evidence in the literature to support your thesis.: Look again at your graphic organizer and look for events that demonstrate all of the reasons your thesis is true. Highlight these events and make sure you have the page numbers.\n\n", 
            "Make an outline.: Make an outline using your thesis statement in order to prepare an organized essay. An outline should have roman numerals for each paragraph and regular numbers for the parts of each paragraph. Look up an example of a good outline to guide you.", 
            "Write the essay.: Writing the essay should not be difficult if you have a detailed outline prepared. Write at least five paragraphs. The thesis statement comes at the end of the first paragraph, and each body paragraph has one or two quotes or examples from the text. Make sure to introduce each quote and then explain the quote or example after you put it in the body paragraphs.\n\n", 
            "Revise the essay.: Be sure to proofread and edit your essay. Look for typos, punctuation errors, and grammar errors. You should correct these mistakes (called revising) before turning in the essay. It is helpful to have someone else read the essay to help you find these errors.\n\n"
        ], 
        "Evaluating Literature as You Read" : [
            "Look up the author and cultural context.: If you are reading a piece of literature with the purpose of critiquing it internally rather than for an essay, you should begin with understanding the cultural milieu of the piece. Knowing the social context of a written work boosts your understanding of the vocabulary, setting, and character motivations, all of which are critical for forming an accurate critique.\n\n", 
            "Highlight and look up words and passages you don’t understand.: Bring a highlighter or pen with you to your reading sessions, and mark words you don’t understand. Looking them up in a dictionary as you read will increase your understanding of the text, just as knowing the cultural milieu in which the text was written does.\n\n", 
            "Investigate the meaning of the title.: Once you begin reading, consider the significance of the title. Ask yourself why the author chose this title. Is it a simple title, merely relating the main setting or object, such as the title of the short story “The Yellow Wallpaper”? If so, why would the author understate the work so much?\n\n", 
            "Decide on the central theme.: Thinking about the title will help you determine the main theme of the work. Determining the main theme provides a trunk from which the branches of the rest of your examination of the text will spring. You will look at the elements of literature of this text, and knowing what theme they should be pointing to helps you to critique how well the author accomplishes this.\n\n", 
            "Examine components of the work.: Examine the elements of the piece of literature you’re reading by exploring how each element is presented in the text. Identify examples of each element and determine how each relates to the main theme. You may want to write down where these connections take place in order to organize your thoughts.", 
            "Form an interpretation of the work.: Once you have analyzed the different elements of the text, you may form an interpretation based on your analyses. This interpretation could be that the author could have done a better job, that the author is profound, that some elements of the text connect to modern society in an interesting way, etc.\n\n"
        ], 
        "Applying Advanced Critical Techniques" : [
            "Read the work of literature critically.: When you read a work of literature with the purpose of critiquing it, whether a poem, short story, nonfiction essay, or memoir, you must read it with an active mind. This means that you should ask questions as you read.", 
            "Evaluate as you read.: Aside from noting when important ideas occur in the margins of the text, you should write down important ideas and themes on a piece of paper as you read, noting the page numbers. You should also think about the text in terms of critical thinking, such as evaluating the work’s clarity, accuracy, and current relevance to society.", 
            "Brainstorm which aspect to write about.: Before you settle on a thesis statement—in fact, to formulate a thesis statement in the first place—you should brainstorm what aspect of the work you want to write about. Look at your notes from while you were reading and see if there are any ideas that you have already extracted from the piece, and place these ideas in your brainstorming. You may want to choose a theme from the work that particularly struck you and critique how well the author presented this theme through the elements you evaluated in your notes. There are many ways to brainstorm, including:", 
            "Formulate a thesis statement.: Once you have populated a brainstorming list and selected a critical perspective (whether based on your own observation or on a critical theory), you should compose a working thesis statement. A “working” thesis is one that can be changed and adapted to your writing as you compose the essay.\n\n", 
            "Create an outline.: You should always use an outline as it requires you to organize your thinking in a logical manner so that your critique is sound and credible. An outline will include elements like your thesis statement, the content of your body paragraphs, and quotes and examples with page numbers. It makes writing the actual essay much easier because all of your research is compiled in one place.", 
            "Select quotes and patterns that support your thesis.: While you are creating the outline, you can start to pick out direct quotes and examples from the text itself (the primary source) and any research you have done (secondary sources). If you place a topic sentence in each body paragraph, you can add the right quotes to support each idea.\n\n", 
            "Find other criticism to support your thesis.: In order to write a strong critique, you need outside sources to agree with you. This boosts the credibility of your argument and shows that you have the strength of mind to think critically about what you read. Outside sources are also called secondary sources, and you need to make sure they are reliable, such as peer reviewed literary journal or magazine articles, published books, and chapters from books.\n\n", 
            "Use the outline to write your paper.: Once you have gathered your research, formed a thesis statement, and filled in a detailed outline, it is time to write the critique. At this point, you will have plenty of information, and all the organization has been done already, so writing the piece should go smoothly.\n\n", 
            "Pay attention to assignment and style guidelines.: Make sure that you follow your instructor’s guidelines for the assignment. For example, you may have specific questions that you need to answer in your paper. You might also have a page length or word count requirement that you need to meet. You will also need to use the correct style to format your paper, such as MLA, APA, or Chicago.\n\n", 
            "Discuss your quotes.: Your paper should include quotes from the primary source (the work of literature itself) and from secondary sources (articles and chapters that help your argument). Make sure you analyze every quote that you include so that you are expressing your own opinion rather than regurgitating someone else’s.\n\n", 
            "Revise your critique.: Proofreading, editing, and revision are all important parts of the writing process and should be done before turning in or publishing a critique of literature. When doing the revision, it is helpful to have someone else look over the essay or read it out loud yourself to find careless mistakes, awkward phrasing, and weak organization.\n\n"

Many autistic people report experiencing therapy abuse in therapies such as ABA and DTT when they were younger.\n\n", 
            "Consider the child's ability to communicate.: Children should be able to communicate basic needs and feelings from a young age, using either speech or AAC. If they can't communicate reliably, then they may be dealing with unmet needs and extreme frustration.\n\n", 
            "Consider whether the child's communication is treated like it's important.: If the child says something that is inconvenient to the adults around them, is it respected or ignored? A child needs to be able to bring up problems, and have them taken seriously.\n\n",

This helps them understand that adults will always listen to them, even in tough times.",

This can include whether it was captive bred or caught from the wild. In addition to this you will want to make sure that the turtle is being kept in a proper habitat and appears alert and healthy. ", 
            "Make sure you choose a healthy turtle.: Since many turtles can be bred in poor conditions or undergo the stresses of being captured from the wild, it is important to choose a healthy looking turtle. The turtle should be alert, free of any parasites, and relatively active. You will want to see that the turtle has an appetite and looks properly fed. Their eyes should be clear, no bubbles from the nose while breathing or wheezing sounds. The limbs should be strong and moving when picked up; listlessness is a sign of illness. There should also be no cracks or pits in the shell or sign of wounds. ",

Make sure that you have a general idea of the size your turtle will reach when full grown so you are not blindsided with keeping a turtle you cannot maintain. ",

It may take a very long time before the turtle learns to recognize and trust you as its caregiver.",

Reading to your child is also a great bonding experience and will encourage them to love books.\n\n", 
            "Set a good example.: Even if your child displays an interest in reading from a young age, he will quickly lose interest if reading is not demonstrated or encouraged in the home. Children learn by example, so pick up a book and show your child that reading is something that adults enjoy too.",

Before reading a new book, just flip through the pages, commenting on the pictures. Show your child how to spot context clues that will help them to read.", 
            "Use variety.: When choosing materials to help your children learn to read, include a mixture of phonics books that they can eventually read all by themselves, slightly more advanced stories that you'll read together and just-for-fun materials of their choice, like comic books and magazines.\n\n", 
            "Be creative.: A little creativity goes a long way when it comes to teaching kids to read. If your child is stimulated by the learning process, you will find it easier to hold their attention and they will learn much faster as a result. Think outside the box and turn learning to read into a fun activity.\n\n"

However, teaching an adult how to read is also an extremely rewarding experience. You will just need time and a considerable amount of patience.\n\n", 
            "Assess their ability.: In order to find out where to begin, you will need to assess your student's current reading ability. This may be a professional assessment or simply asking the learner to do whatever reading and writing he/she already knows, and taking note of where he/she struggles.\n\n",

Many adults suffer from a lack of confidence and from the fear that it is too late for them to learn how to read. Express confidence in their learning abilities and reassure them that it is never to late to start.\n\n", 
            "Use appropriate materials.: When teaching adults, look for materials that are not too childish, or at least ask whether they mind using children's materials. However, keep in mind that children's books can be easy beginning materials, as they use simple words and rhymes to reinforce the connection between letter patterns and sounds.\n\n",

        "Method One of Three:" : [
            "Teach the alphabet.: The first step in learning to read is recognizing the letters of the alphabet. Use a poster, chalkboard, or notebook to write or display the alphabet. Go over the letters with the student until he or she learns them all. Use the alphabet song to help the student to remember.\n\n", 
            "Teach sounds.: Once your student is familiar with the alphabet, you will need to teach them the sounds of each letter. Learning the name of the letter is not enough, as a letter may be pronounced differently depending on the word. For example the ''", 
            "Teach short, one-syllable words.: Introduce your student to basic reading by showing them two or three letter, one-syllable words. Beginners tend to do best with words that have a consonant-vowel-consonant pattern, such as CAT or DOG.\n\n", 
            "Teach sight words.: Sight words are words that need to be learned by heart as they diverge from the normal rules of spelling. Many sight words such as \"father\", \"again\" and \"friend\" are also high frequency words. For this reason, it is very important that readers are able to instantly recognize these words when they come across them in a text.\n\n", 
            "Build vocabulary.: A student's reading vocabulary is defined as the the number of words that they know and understand as they read.", 
            "Build fluency.: Fluency is the ability to read quickly and accurately, with appropriate rhythm, intonation, and expression. Beginner readers do not possess this ability. As a result, they often struggle through texts that are beyond their \"comfort\" level. Without fluency, a reader will focus all of their energies on correctly pronouncing the words in front of them, rather than absorbing their meaning. When this happens, the reader fails to understand the meaning of the text, making the ability to read it pointless. That is why building fluency is so important.\n\n", 
            "Test reading comprehension.: Reading comprehension is the process of constructing meaning from what is read. In order to comprehend a text, a reader must associate the words they read with their actual meaning. Enabling your student to comprehend the text they are reading is your main goal as a teacher, as without comprehension, reading is meaningless.\n\n"

Think about how to compose each panel and how to make your point to the reader. Don't be afraid to try lots of different thumbnails, organizing your story in different ways.

This is called \"penciling.\" Try to use a sharpened pencil so people can read your comic. Maybe a mechanical pencil would be good. Some artists use non-repro blue pencils to rough in their characters and panel designs.

Using Penstix, Rapidograph, or quills, brushes and India ink will bring life to the work.

Ink in the lines of the borders.\n\n",

Use pencil to rough in your letters - nothing looks worse than running out of room in a word balloon.

Whether you are a mother or father, husband or wife, son or daughter, engaging with your family provides you with psychological support and shores up an important aspect of yourself that can help to compensate for the damage to your work identity.\n\n",

If you're playing inside, make sure that no children go outside, that they are playing safely and not playing dangerously (putting a coin in an electrical outlet if they are playing telephone booth for example) and that they stay out of all of the off-limits rooms, such as their parent's room. If you're playing with a child younger than four, stay with the child/children at all times while you're playing the game (especially if the child is younger than four), and be aware of where the child/children are the entire time you're babysitting.\n\n",

Most kids really enjoy this! Make sure that even if the play is extremely boring, look like you're having fun watching the skit! Most of the time, though, the kids come up with some great plays. Before you leave the kids alone, make it clear that they can only stick to a certain area (like the playroom or a bedroom) so that they aren't looking for prop ideas in other rooms and that should prevent the children from getting into lots of mischief.\n\n", 
            "Play Freeze Dance!: Take turns being the person in charge of the music, and turn the music on and off. When it's off, stop. When it comes back on, dance! You can also play this game just by moving around, if you don't want to dance.\n\n", 
            "Play Statues.: Pick one person to be \"It\". Everyone else moves around (dancing, jumping, or just walking) and when \"It\" says \"Statues!\" everyone freezes in whatever position they were in (if someone's arm is up, it stays up, or if someone's in a running position, they stay in that position). \"It\" walks around trying to make one person after another laugh or move. Whoever laughs first is \"It\" next!\n\n",

The last person who finds \"It\" is \"It\" next! \"It\" or not, they'll have fun!\n\n",

The first player takes the stick or small rock and throws it onto a square of the snail. That player then walks on all of the squares of the snail starting at the snail's head and going around until they get into the middle of the snail's body, but the player jumps over the square with the stick/rock on it. If the player steps on all of the squares without losing her balance and without stepping on a line, she gets to write the first letter of her name in any one of the squares that she chooses. Then its the next player's turn, only now that player has to skip the square with the rock/stick in it and also the square with the first player's initial in it. Every time a player gets around the entire snail without stepping on the square with the stick in it, without stepping on a line, and without stepping in squares with their opponent's initials, they get to pick a square to put their initial in. Players are allowed to step in squares that have their initial, but not in squares that have an opponent's initial. The game continues until all of the squares are filled up. The player with the most amount of squares filled with her initial wins.\n\n",

When \"Daddy/Mommy\" hears someone make a noise, he/she says \"Bring bring bring\" then he/she counts to 5 out loud. When \"Daddy/Mommy\" starts saying \"bring bring bring\", the other children all run to their pillows around the room and pretend to be asleep. Once the \"Daddy/Mommy\" is done counting to 5 he/she opens their eyes to see if anyone is still running to a pillow or not looking like they are asleep. If someone is not doing what he or she should be doing (\"sleeping\" on a pillow) then the \"Daddy/Mommy\" calls their name and they are the new \"Daddy/Mommy\".\n\n",

Take colored pencils and paper and put the leaf under the paper. Then lightly use the edge of a colored pencil to draw over the leaf, until the pattern of the leaf shows. Then cut the leaves out and glue them to a piece of paper! Look at all the pretty leaves!\n\n",

Place on the middle rack under the broiler and watch it like a hawk. Once they brown – within a minute or two — rotate them with a spatula and toast the other side.\n\n",

Having a place set aside for studying and learning can also help, because it triggers your brain into working in a particular way.\n\n", 
            "Work with your learning style.: Learning styles are the different ways in which our brains best absorb information. There are many different learning styles and while we all can learn using every learning style, there are usually one or two that work best for an individual. You can take online tests to help gauge what your learning style might be, but if you have a teacher available to help you, they should be able to help you figure it out. You can even talk to them about adding more of that learning style to how they teach.\n\n", 
            "Learn in the right way for the type of material you’re working with.: Different kinds of subjects are learned better in different ways. You might not be studying for the subject you want to learn in the most helpful way. Adjust how you study so that you’re learning the right skills in a way that works with your brain.\n\n", 
            "Get evaluated for a learning disability.: If you really find that you can’t focus while learning or that your brain doesn’t seem to absorb any of the information, even with help and different techniques, then you might want to consider getting evaluated for a learning disability. There are lots of learning disabilities and most are fairly common (it is estimated that as much as 1 out of every 5 people in the US have one"

            "Eat well.: Treating your body well is half the battle of entering the right mindset. There are certain foods you can eat that will improve your focus and your general well-being. Studies show that eating high-carb, high-fiber, slow-digesting foods like oatmeal are best for the morning of a test. The food you consume the two weeks leading up to the exam are just as important and effect how you study. Eat a well balanced diet that includes fruits and vegetables.", 
            "Stimulate your circulatory system.: This system controls your heart and blood path. Part of healthy studying is a healthy flow of blood to your brain. Studies have proved that 20 minutes stimulating this system improves your memory. Don't feel obliged to go on a run if you don't want to. Bust a move in your living room to your favorite dance track. Let this be your time to unwind and alleviate stress during your study break.", 
            "Sleep well.: Getting a full nights rest, between 7-8 hours, helps motivate you to study. If you are sleep deprived, studying will feel like a chore. You won't learn nearly as much information sleepy as you will after a good night's rest.\n\n"

It's common for students to take a small break after school and then study. Take time to have a quick snack and then sit down to study. If you finish your work in the afternoon, you can relax in the evening.", 
            "Have a good space to study.: You need a desk or a table with a decent amount of space. You will also need good lighting. Students will often say that listening to music, having the TV on, or keeping their phone out helps, but these are all distractions. If you can't work in silence, listen to ambient music instead of music that's lyric driven.\n\n",

You don't need to be a lone wolf when it comes to academics. Humans are social creatures. Even if you feel that you don't know as much as these other students, you should still try it. You'll find that you do have something to contribute to the group.\n\n",

            "Understand what you're learning.: It's common for students to memorize what they know they'll be tested on, but it's not as efficient. Understanding what you study increases your chances of retaining it. You might not care to retain trigonometry past your final exam, but in the long run, you will.", 
            "Use flash cards.: This is one of the best techniques you can use in studying that stretches across almost every subject. The act of writing out the information onto the card begins your brain's focus onto the subject. Once you've finished you can test yourself for an extended period of time, and then let others test you.\n\n", 
            "Rewrite your notes.: Some people may find this excruciating because they already spent a fair amount of time creating the notes in class. Rewrite your notes by adding more information to them. Don't just sift through your notes mindlessly transcribing them. Use external sources like a textbook or an assigned essay.", 
            "Take breaks.: After spending a decent amount of time studying, between 45 minutes to an hour, take a quick break, 10-15 minutes. This is a tried and true learning method. After your break revisit what you were previously working on as a test. Revisiting subjects after distancing yourself will reinforce the materials into your brain.", 
            "Test yourself.: After studying for your allotted chunk of time, test yourself during the last 20 or 30 minutes. This is a good way of reviewing everything you just went over and will cause the concepts you've learned to sink deeper into your brain. Textbooks often have practice tests at the end of a chapter. Try your best to go through one of these even if it isn't assigned.",

Carry a small pocket journal around with you and make note of times that you did something wrong.

If you set “be-good” goals, you are raising the stakes and telling yourself that you need to succeed in order to be a good person. “Get-better” goals, on the other hand, are all about improvement.

We can’t exert maximum effort every single day in every element of our lives. Things that we do frequently, such as driving to work or making breakfast, can become so habitual that we don’t focus on them.

Instead of this unrealistic goal, try to reframe your decisions as experiments instead. An experiment may have good or bad consequences. You can still do your best to achieve good consequences, of course, but this will take some of the pressure off.",

Press the flat end that once attached to the root to the top of the fine side of the grater. Move the onion in a downward motion over the holes to grate it. Continue to press the onion against the grater, moving it up and down over the holes, until you have grated the entire onion.\n\n",

Grab the partially cut end and pull it down, past the length of the onion, to draw back a portion of the skin.

A hand juicer, or a juicer that requires you to press the fruit or vegetable against a bump to extract the juice, only works with soft fruits like lemons, oranges, and limes. To extract juice from hard vegetables like onions, you need a juicer with a spout that you can feed pieces of the vegetable into.\n\n",

The symptoms you experience from a first degree burn include:",

            "Watch for a fourth degree burn.: A fourth degree burn is the most severe burn you can have. This is a severe injury and requires immediate emergency assistance. The symptoms include:", 
            "Look for a major burn.: No matter what degree a burn is, a burn can be considered a major burn if it covers the joints or is over the majority of your body.

If the burns wrap around the entire surrounding tissue of any or several of your fingers, you should seek medical attention as soon as you can. This can restrict the flow of blood to your fingers, which, in extreme cases, could lead to finger amputation if left untreated.", 
            "Clean the burn.: If the burn is minor you can take care of the wound at home. The first step is to clean the burn. To do this remove any clothing that covers the burn and immerse in cold water. Running water over it can damage the skin and may increase the likelihood of scarring or complicating damage. Do not use hot water because it can irritate the burn.\n", 
            "Cool the burn.: After you wash the burn immerse the burned area in cool water for 15 to 20 minutes. Do not use ice or running water because this can cause further damage. Next, wet a washcloth with cool water and apply it to your burn, but do not rub. Just lay the cloth over the area.\n\n", 
            "Prevent infection.: In order to help prevent the burn from becoming infected, you need to take care of it after you cool it off. Apply an antibiotic ointment such as Neosporin or bacitracin with a clean finger or a cotton ball. If the burn is an open wound use non-stick gauze instead because the fibers of a cotton ball may catch in an open wound. Next, cover the burn with a bandage that doesn't stick to the burn area, such as Telfa. Change the bandage one to two times a day and reapply the ointment.\n\n", 
            "Treat the pain.: Any minor burn you experience will likely cause pain. Once you cover the wound, raise the area of your burn above your heart. This will decrease any swelling and ease your pain. To help with any lingering pain, take over-the-counter pain medications, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil and Motrin). Take these pills several times a day as instructed as long as the pain stays.\n\n"

            "Remove any clothing.: While you wait for help to arrive, take off any constrictive clothing and jewelry that are on or near the burn site. However, leave on any clothing or jewelry that might be stuck in the burn. This will pull off the skin at the site of the burn and cause further injury.\n\n",

Exposure through ingestion can lead to nausea, vomiting, burns to the mouth and airways, and abdominal pain. You may also experience necrosis of areas of the stomach and digestive tract, which can cause severe pain due to localized tissue death.\n\n", 
            "Drink a lot of water.: If you ingested HF, you need to drink a large quantity of water right away. This will help dilute the acid in your system and ease the severity of the damage. Do not induce vomiting. You can also drink some milk. If exposed person is alert, give them 4-8 ounces of milk or water.\n\n", 
            "Seek medical attention : Ingestional exposure is life threatening and can cause a lot of permanent damage to organs. Always seek immediate medical attention as soon as you suspect HF exposure. You will likely be started on a treatment regime that will help neutralize the acid, even if you have done it yourself on the way to emergency care.\n\n", 
            "Neutralize the acid.: After drinking milk or water and calling for help, it is necessary to attempt to bind certain substances in HF with a neutralizing substance. Take some Tums, which are chewable calcium tablets that can help during HF ingestion. The calcium can help bind the HF in your system.\n\n", 
            "Get additional tests.: Your doctor will perform additional blood tests to assess any large decreases in calcium due to binding with the ingested HF. This can lead to cardiac problems, including cardiac arrest. A urinalysis will also be done in order to assess your fluid levels. This will help to guide fluid management and help with replenishing of any depleted electrolytes.\n\n"

Direct contact with HF can cause major damage to your skin tissue, as HF is a corrosive substance that burns. It can also penetrate the skin and cause even further damage under the skin.",

            "Remove all contaminated clothing immediately.: If there is any part of your clothing that has been saturated with HF, remove it immediately from your body or any portion of your skin. This will prevent more acid from touching the skin, as well as stop continued exposure that may cause more serious burning.\n\n", 
            "Flush the burned area.: If you come into contact with HF, flush the burned area under a safety shower or suitable hose. Orient the burned area so that water runs down and off your skin. Make sure that the water coming into contact with the affected area does not come into contact with any other part of your body.\n\n", 
            "Have another person call for medical assistance.: HF burns are very serious and can lead to many systemic issues and even death. You need to get help as soon as possible because HF burns require expert medical attention regardless of how you feel or what you believe is necessary. Have someone else call for you while you deal with preventing continued exposure to the acid.\n\n",

Keep applying gel for at least twenty minutes. This should be the first line of care if available after extensive rinsing with water.\n\n", 
            "Get treated.: Seeking medical care from professionals will help assess long-term side effects of the burn. The goal of treatment is reduce the effects of HF burns while simultaneously controlling the pain from exposure. Prior to discharge, your doctor will assess your electrolyte balances with a blood test, test for any heart palpitations and arrhythmias, and review your Echocardiogram (ECG) to make sure it is normal.\n\n"

            "Immediately remove the person from the HF source.: You will likely not be able to check yourself for inhalation of HF because of the symptoms. However, if you come upon someone who has or might have inhaled HF, check the affected person’s vital signs.\n\n", 
            "Seek medical attention : Inhalation exposure is rapidly lethal, which means you need to seek medical attention as soon as possible. Inhalation of HF can cause serious damage and treatment should be done in a medical setting because there is little to no effective treatment outside of a clinical setting.\n\n",

This will flush out the acid and help prevent continued damage to the eyes. If only one eye has been contaminated, be sure to not wash acid into the other eye. Keep your eyelids apart and away from the eyeballs while washing.\n\n",

You will most likely continue to receive flushing of the eye, as well as topical tetracaine ointment and a 1% calcium gluconate flush.\n\n",

Keep applying gel for at least twenty minutes. This should be the first line of care if available after extensive rinsing with water.\n\n", 
            "Get treated.: Seeking medical care from professionals will help assess long-term side effects of the burn. The goal of treatment is reduce the effects of HF burns while simultaneously controlling the pain from exposure. Prior to discharge, your doctor will assess your electrolyte balances with a blood test, test for any heart palpitations and arrhythmias, and review your Echocardiogram (ECG) to make sure it is normal.\n\n"

This will flush out the acid and help prevent continued damage to the eyes. If only one eye has been contaminated, be sure to not wash acid into the other eye. Keep your eyelids apart and away from the eyeballs while washing.\n\n",

            "Assess the spill.: Very quickly, you will need to decide if this is a spill that can be handled by the laboratory staff, or one that requires immediate, large-scale evacuation. This will vary slightly by the capacity of your laboratory and staff. Make sure you understand what types of spills fall under which category. When an emergency occurs, quickly decide what needs to be done.\n\n",

For example, you should wear closed toe shoes, long pants, and keep your hair pulled back.", 
            "Protect your eyes with safety goggles.: It is also crucial for you to protect your eyes when working with acids. Use a pair of a large safety goggles that cover your eyes, both in the front and on both sides. Safety goggles often come in multiple sizes, and sometimes have an adjustable strap in the back. Be sure to select goggles that fit properly, and/or make adjustments for a snug fit.",

            "Educate yourself on what to do in the event of a spill.: When a chemical or acid spill occurs, you must act quickly without panicking. You will be better able to accomplish this task if you are well educated on what to do.\n\n"

Different acids will have divergent effects on these materials. As such, it is crucial to determine which material will be best suited for storing and transferring the acid (or acids) you will be using.", 
            "Check containers for any damages or leaks.: In addition to selecting the correct material for your containers, it is very important to ensure that your containers are intact. Carefully inspect each container for leaks, cracks, or other damage before use.\n\n", 
            "Utilize a fume hood.: An excellent safety measure is to conduct all operations involving acid underneath a fume hood. It is best to work at least six inches inside the fume hood, to ensure the highest level of contaminant capture.", 
            "Use the right size container for the job.: In addition to selecting a container of the proper material, it is most safe to use a container of the correct size. Use of a container that is too large or too small can result in spills, leaks, or other hazards.", 
            "Store acids in a dedicated “corrosives cabinet.:” For your own safety and the safety of your lab, it is a good idea to store all acids in a dedicated “corrosives cabinet” or “acid cabinet.” For the most part, you will want to avoid storing acids alongside bases."

Stick the burned area under cool running water for 10-15 minutes or until the pain subsides. Avoid using cold water, since this can damage the skin around the burn.", 
            "Remove tight clothing or jewelry quickly.: As soon as you can, or while rinsing the burn, remove anything that might constrict your skin as the wound swells. When in doubt, take it off. This lets blood to flow to the wound and starts healing it. Removing tight clothing or jewelry can also prevent further damage.", 
            "Apply a cold compress.: If cold water isn’t an option, use a cold compress or ice pack wrapped in a towel. Place it over your burn. Apply the compress for 10-15 minutes, wait for 30 minutes, and then reapply for 10-15 minutes.", 
            "Take an over the counter pain reliever.: An over-the-counter pain reliever such as ibuprofen, acetaminophen, aspirin, or naproxen can be helpful if the symptoms are bothering you. If the pain does not lessen after several hours, take another dose of the medication. Avoid giving aspirin to young children or if you are recently recovering from the flu or chickenpox.", 
            "Clean the burn.: After washing your hands, use soap and water to clean the burn and prevent infection. Apply an antibiotic like Neosporin when you are done to keep the burn clean.",

            "Avoid using home remedies like egg whites, butter, and tea.: The internet is awash with \"miracle\" solutions for burns, but few scientific studies have actually proven them to work.", 
            "Watch the burn for infection.: Keep an eye on the wound for changes in color to red, brown, or black. Also, watch for any green discoloration of fat layers under and around the wound. Seek medical attention if a burn does not heal over several weeks. A burn that refuses to heal can be a sign of complications, infection, or a more serious burn.", 
            "Alleviate itching with topicals.: Itching is a common complaint among patients during the initial healing period after minor burns. Topicals such as aloe vera or petroleum based jelly can soothe the discomfort caused by itching. Oral antihistamines can also be taken to help with the itchiness.\n\n"

Symptoms that result from the bite can manifest at any point from a couple of hours to more than a week after the bite occurred.\n\n",

Most species of mosquitoes lay their eggs in stagnant water and some have even adapted to lay their eggs in salt water.", 
            "Don't let water stand near your home or campsite.: It's easy to unintentionally create habitats for mosquitoes to live and breed in. For instance, a kiddy pool left out in the summer sun for several days can soon become a hotbed for mosquitoes. Get rid of any standing water around your home or campsite. If you have a pool, cover it when it's not in use and treat the water with chemical additives like chlorine according to the manufacturer's instructions. Here are just a few places water can accumulate:\n\n",

Here are a few common chemical solutions effective at repelling mosquitoes:\n\n", 
            "Consider an all-natural solution.: Experiment with non chemical solutions such as Citronella (natural plant oil). Tea tree oil and vitamin B have reportedly helped some people repel mosquitoes. As with any product, their effectiveness depends on the situation, your own skin chemistry, and the exact type of mosquito you are dealing with. Note, however, that so-called \"alternative\" solutions sometimes aren't held to the testing standards that mainstream commercial repellents are - research alternative solutions and read testimonials before spending any money.\n\n", 
            "Wear loose, long-sleeved shirts and long pants when outdoors.: One of the best ways to keep mosquitoes from biting you is to simply cover your skin. Wear your sleeves and pant legs as long as possible to cover as much skin as possible. Also keep your clothing as loose as possible. This serves two purposes: first, it's much more comfortable in the hot,humid weather where mosquitoes thrive. Second, mosquitoes can sometimes bite through clothing that's held tight against the skin, especially if the fabric is thin.\n\n",

            "Sleep with a mosquito net over your bed.: The mosquito netting has fine holes big enough to allow breezes to easily pass through but small enough to keep mosquitoes and other biting insects out. Hang the netting over your bed, securing the top of the net to one or more surfaces. Support the net so that it's tented without hanging down onto you. Make sure to sleep without touching the sides - mosquitoes can actually bite you through the netting if it's tight against your skin.

            "Use a mosquito swatter.: The swatter, usually made of a thicker metal or plastic, is mounted on the end of a springy wire, dramatically increasing your chances of hitting a stationary mosquito by increasing the momentum of the swat. You can also use your hand in a similar flipping motion.\n\n",

There isn't any scientific research to support this claim. Even if you can get this method to work, you'll still be left with an especially big bite and you'll still be putting yourself at risk for malaria, West Nile virus, etc. If you're trying to avoid mosquito bites, why kill the mosquito by ", 
            "Trap the mosquito in a cup.: If the above steps aren't working or the thought of killing a mosquito makes you feel guilty, you can try catching a mosquito alive, then releasing it outside of your home or camp. Slowly place a cup (preferably made of a hard material) over the mosquito and then slide some paper underneath this cup. This gives you control over the mosquito and can provide you with a more pacifistic approach, instead of just killing the mosquito. Carefully hold the paper over the cup's bottom as you relocate the mosquito to a more appropriate habitat.\n\n"

Look for guides at a local library, or see if you can find spider enthusiast websites for your area.\n\n",

            "Note a refusal to eat.: Is your tarantula eating? Before a big molt, tarantulas will stop eating for extended periods of time, ranging from a few weeks to a couple of months. If you have noticed that your tarantula has not been eating or that she has been eating less than usual, then this could indicate that she is going to molt soon.\n\n", 
            "Check for clear fluid droplets.: Some tarantulas secrete tiny drops of a clear fluid between the joints on their legs, and this can indicate that your tarantula is getting ready to molt. Check to see if you can see these droplets, but keep in mind that not all tarantulas do this before a molt.", 
            "Look for thinning hair or a bald spot.: Some tarantulas will lose hair on their abdomens leading up to a molt. You might notice less hair on your tarantula’s abdomen or even a bald spot on your tarantula’s abdomen.",

            "Slide the refrigerator away from the wall and secure it to the dolly.: With most fridges, you should be able to slide the dolly right under, lifting it gently if necessary. Tie the refrigerator to the dolly with the use of moving straps or bungees. Make sure that you minimize any tilting when lifting and positioning the refrigerator on the dolly. Maintain its upright position, to ensure that oil will not seep into the cooling tubes.\n\n", 
            "Tilt the fridge gently.: When you've got the fridge hooked up to the dolly, roll it slowly to the truck that you're packing, moving forward. It's important to move in the direction opposite the tilt to maintain the most security. Have a helper assist on the other side, coaching you through obstacles and helping to secure the fridge.", 
            "Load the fridge into the truck.: Whether you're moving your fridge into a pick-up or a moving truck, back it up to the bed, placing the dolly between the lip of the truck bed and the fridge. Ideally, a moving truck will have a truck ramp that you'll be able to roll it up easily. If not, you'll have to use a bit more care.\n\n", 
            "Move the fridge into the new space.: Let the refrigerator down and move it into the new place just as you moved it out. Allow it to sit for at least 3 hours before plugging it in. This will allow for the oil and fluid to flow back into its compressor, and would prevent any damage to the appliance. It would take around 3 days for the refrigerator to return to its ideal cooling temperature and be useable.\n\n"
        ], 
        "Part One of Two:" : [
            "Empty the refrigerator of all its contents.: Before you try to move a fridge, it's best to take everything out. Make sure that both your refrigerator and freezer are free of food, condiments, ice cube trays, and anything else that might rattle around and shift weight. Remove items placed outside of your refrigerator as well, such as magnets.\n\n", 
            "Remove the shelves.: Remove all removable components from the inside of the fridge, including shelves, trays, and other loose or movable items, organizers, and dividers. Wrap the shelves in towels for protection, then label and stack them carefully.\n\n", 
            "Unplug the refrigerator.: Coil the power cord securely and tape it in a tight bundle to make sure that it stays in place while moving. If your refrigerator has an ice maker, disconnect this from the water source as well.\n\n", 
            ".: If a considerable amount of frost has built up in the freezer, you'll need to defrost it before going forward with the move. This would normally take 6 to 8 hours to complete, so make sure you have ample time before the move. It is best to do this the night before the move so there would be enough time to defrost overnight, and you can wipe the inside of the refrigerator in the morning.\n\n", 
            "Close and secure the doors.: Fasten the refrigerator and freezer doors snugly shut using strong rope or bungee cord. If your refrigerator has a double-door, tie the door handles together as well. Be careful not to tie the refrigerator too tightly, or the doors may be pulled out of alignment. It is not recommended to use tape for securing the door, since it may either damage the finish of the refrigerator, or leave a residue.\n\n", 
            "Find some helpers.: Because a fridge needs to be held upright and operated using a dolly, it can be tempting to go it alone, but it's always safer to lift heavy objects and negotiate them through doors, around corners, down stairs, and into a truck with the aid of some assistants. Moving a refrigerator is a job for at least two."

Ozone in small quantities is generally considered safe, but in moderate to high levels it may irritate the throat, cause watery eyes, or aggravate asthma symptoms. To neutralize bad smells a generator must be able to produce 1000mg/hr and remain at that level for 1 hour for a 100 s.f. area. Ozone leaves a distinctive smell of its own, oftentimes referred to as the \"thunderstorm smell\" (lightning produces high quantities of ozone). However, depending on what Ozone binds to, certain molds for instance, it can create a different type of smell that can linger for many weeks. There is not a lot of literature on Ozone effectiveness and many manufacturers claims are exaggerated or unsubstantiated (see "

Give it some time to absorb oils and smells, then thoroughly vacuum it out, making several passes. Carpet deodorizers often come with their own scent which also stays around for a while, so make sure you pick one with a scent you actually like. Vacuuming also pulls dust and debris out of the carpets.\n\n",

Dry clean anything that can't be washed but ask first, as dry cleaning can set some odors for good (such as mothball scent).\n\n",

Go outside where the air circulation is better and where the breeze can naturally carry the smoke away from you.\n\n",

You'll be able to keep your first layer smelling smoke free. You'll still carry the smell with you, but there's considerably less of your clothing that will smell like smoke.\n", 
            "Wear a hat and gloves.: When you smoke, you can have a whole outfit set aside just for smoking, so that you can change into and out of it and avoid getting caught. Cover all of your hair with a stocking cap and wear thin gloves.\n\n", 
            "Smoke standing up so the smell doesn't get into your pants or shoes.: It might sound stupid, but keeping the cigarette as far away from your body as possible will cut down considerably on the smell. Most of the stink doesn't come from the smoke you inhale and exhale, but from the smoke from the burning cigarette. Keep it away from you by setting it in an ashtray or on a log when you're not smoking to cut down on the cling.\n\n"

You might even consider chewing some gum while you smoke and then popping in another piece when you're finished.\n", 
            "Wash your hands well with soap.: The hand in which you hold your cigarette will have the most lingering smell. Washing them thoroughly is the most practical way of getting the smoke off your hands. Use a strongly-scented liquid soap to get the most effective cleaning.\n", 
            "Clean your face.: Washing your face with soap and water is also important. Scrub your face quickly as you wash your hands, particularly around your chin and mouth. If you have facial hair, pay particular attention to getting deep in your beard and scrubbing.\n", 
            "Air out your hair.: If you have long hair, put it back in a ponytail before smoking and let it down when you're finished. Walk around a bit before you have to be around people, or drive with the windows down to get the smell out naturally.\n", 
            "Use dryer sheets or Febreeze on your clothes.: To make your clothes smell like clothes, use fabric sheets, which are made to absorb smells like smoke.

Stuff as many dryer sheets as you can into the TP tube and fix one sheet over the end, holding it in place using the rubber band. When you smoke, blow the smoke through the other end of the tube. It'll smell much less strongly.\n\n",

Incense is a particularly good option, especially if you already burn it regularly, because it smells like smoke already. Suspicious parents or roommates might not recognize the undertone of cigarette funk underneath the Nag Champa.",

If you want to get rid of the smoke smell, consider getting out the vacuum and giving the carpet a once-over. Vacuuming won't be enough by itself, but just agitating the carpet some can help air it out a little bit.\n\n",

Its odor-eliminating properties and clean scent do wonders for masking the smell of cigarettes indoors. Keep a bottle handy and regularly treat fabric surfaces (as well as clothes) that you won't to remove the clinging smell of smoke from."

Ozone in small quantities is generally considered safe, but in moderate to high levels it may irritate the throat, cause watery eyes, or aggravate asthma symptoms. To neutralize bad smells a generator must be able to produce 1000mg/hr and remain at that level for 1 hour for a 100 s.f. area. Ozone leaves a distinctive smell of its own, oftentimes referred to as the \"thunderstorm smell\" (lightning produces high quantities of ozone). However, depending on what Ozone binds to, certain molds for instance, it can create a different type of smell that can linger for many weeks. There is not a lot of literature on Ozone effectiveness and many manufacturers claims are exaggerated or unsubstantiated (see "

        "Method Two of Three:" : [
            "Always smoke outside.: If you're worried about being caught, smoking indoors has a tendency to make the smoke cling to you even worse, making it difficult to get the smoke smell off. Go outside where the air circulation is better and where the breeze can naturally carry the smoke away from you.\n\n", 
            "Remove outerwear before smoking.: If you can, take any jacket or coat you're wearing off before smoking and keep in a separate room, or keep clear of the smell of the smoke. You'll be able to keep your first layer smelling smoke free. You'll still carry the smell with you, but there's considerably less of your clothing that will smell like smoke.\n", 
            "Wear a hat and gloves.: When you smoke, you can have a whole outfit set aside just for smoking, so that you can change into and out of it and avoid getting caught. Cover all of your hair with a stocking cap and wear thin gloves.\n\n", 
            "Smoke standing up so the smell doesn't get into your pants or shoes.: It might sound stupid, but keeping the cigarette as far away from your body as possible will cut down considerably on the smell. Most of the stink doesn't come from the smoke you inhale and exhale, but from the smoke from the burning cigarette. Keep it away from you by setting it in an ashtray or on a log when you're not smoking to cut down on the cling.\n\n"
        ], 
        "Covering the Smell on Yourself" : [
            "Keep the window cracked.: If you're going to smoke indoors and want to ease up on the aftermath, smoke near open windows. Blowing the smoke out the window and keeping your burning cigarettes as close as possible to the window is the best way to cut down on the lingering smell of the smoke.\n\n", 
            "Use a homemade smoke scrubber.: Sometimes called a rasta tube, all you need to create nice-smelling smoke on your exhales is a toilet paper tube, some dryer sheets, and a rubber band. Stuff as many dryer sheets as you can into the TP tube and fix one sheet over the end, holding it in place using the rubber band. When you smoke, blow the smoke through the other end of the tube. It'll smell much less strongly.\n\n", 
            "Burn incense and candles.: Keeping a good supply of scented candles and strong incense to burn while you smoke is a good idea in masking the smell of the cigarettes. Incense is a particularly good option, especially if you already burn it regularly, because it smells like smoke already. Suspicious parents or roommates might not recognize the undertone of cigarette funk underneath the Nag Champa.", 
            "Vacuum.: If you're in a carpeted room, there's that much more opportunity for smoke to become embedded in the room. If you want to get rid of the smoke smell, consider getting out the vacuum and giving the carpet a once-over. Vacuuming won't be enough by itself, but just agitating the carpet some can help air it out a little bit.\n\n", 
            "Spray Febreeze on curtains, carpet, and other fabric.: Febreeze is a smoker's best friend. Its odor-eliminating properties and clean scent do wonders for masking the smell of cigarettes indoors. Keep a bottle handy and regularly treat fabric surfaces (as well as clothes) that you won't to remove the clinging smell of smoke from."
        ], 
        "Method One of Three:" : [
            "Chew gum.: Keep gum handy to pop a piece in your mouth after you've smoked a cigarette to give yourself minty breath. Along with other methods, chewing gum is the easiest and best way to mask the smell of cigarettes. You might even consider chewing some gum while you smoke and then popping in another piece when you're finished.\n", 
            "Wash your hands well with soap.: The hand in which you hold your cigarette will have the most lingering smell. Washing them thoroughly is the most practical way of getting the smoke off your hands. Use a strongly-scented liquid soap to get the most effective cleaning.\n", 
            "Clean your face.: Washing your face with soap and water is also important. Scrub your face quickly as you wash your hands, particularly around your chin and mouth. If you have facial hair, pay particular attention to getting deep in your beard and scrubbing.\n", 
            "Air out your hair.: If you have long hair, put it back in a ponytail before smoking and let it down when you're finished. Walk around a bit before you have to be around people, or drive with the windows down to get the smell out naturally.\n", 
            "Use dryer sheets or Febreeze on your clothes.: To make your clothes smell like clothes, use fabric sheets, which are made to absorb smells like smoke. Febreeze has a light natural smell that serves a similar function, working to remove the smell rather than simply mask it like a cologne, aftershave, or perfume.\n"
